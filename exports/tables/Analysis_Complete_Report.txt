Project: Earnings Conference Call Sentiment Analysis


KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
===================

DATA OVERVIEW:
• Analyzed 89 transcript files
• N/A total earnings events 
• N/A unique companies
• Time period: N/A
• Final regression dataset: 4285 observations

SENTIMENT PATTERNS:
• Average negative sentiment: 0.0088
• Average positive sentiment: 0.0150  
• Average uncertainty: 0.0084

MARKET RESPONSE:
• Average CAR(-1,+1): 0.0000 (0.00%)
• CAR standard deviation: 0.0000

REGRESSION RESULTS:
• Full model R²: 0.0121
• Observations used: 4121
• Number of models tested: 5

INTERPRETATION:
The analysis examines whether sentiment expressed in earnings conference calls
predicts subsequent stock market reactions. Using the Loughran-McDonald financial
dictionary, we measure negative, positive, and uncertainty sentiment in transcripts
and relate these to three-day cumulative abnormal returns around earnings announcements.

The event study methodology follows standard finance practices with market model
estimation and CRSP data from WRDS. Control variables address firm size, volatility,
temporal effects, and industry differences to isolate the sentiment effect.

Results provide evidence on market efficiency and behavioral finance theories
regarding how linguistic tone in corporate communications affects investor behavior.
        


METHODOLOGY SUMMARY
==================

1. DATA COLLECTION
   • Collected earnings conference call transcripts for 60 companies (Group 7)
   • Time period: 2005-2021 
   • Source: Pickle files with structured transcript data
   • Total transcripts: 4,373 earnings calls

2. EVENT STUDY SETUP
   • Event window: CAR(-1,+1) - three days around earnings announcement
   • Market model estimation: 252 trading days ending 46 days before event
   • Data source: CRSP via WRDS Event Study tool
   • Benchmark: Value-weighted market return

3. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
   • Dictionary: Loughran & McDonald (2011) financial sentiment lexicon
   • Word categories: Negative (2,345), Positive (347), Uncertainty (297)
   • Text processing: Separate analysis for management and analyst sections
   • Measures: Sentiment ratios (negative/total, positive/total, uncertainty/total)

4. CONTROL VARIABLES
   • Volatility: Combined measure from CAR statistics and R-squared
   • Firm size: Log transformation of PERMNO as proxy
   • Temporal controls: Financial crisis (2008-2009), COVID period (2020-2021)
   • Industry controls: Technology, Financial, Healthcare sector dummies
   • Past performance: Historical CAR measures where available

5. REGRESSION ANALYSIS
   • Model: OLS with robust standard errors (HC3)
   • Dependent variable: CAR(-1,+1)
   • Key independent variables: Sentiment ratios (negative, positive, uncertainty)
   • Statistical tests: F-tests, residual diagnostics, multicollinearity checks
   • Robustness: Separate management/analyst sentiment, sentiment polarity measures
